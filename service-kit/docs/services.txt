A vendor has classes (services).

Symsonte gives a way to load those services using dependency injection.
But you should declare your dependency setup classes.

Those classes must have the tag "setup_init" and will be called when the container is being

It can also inject some pioneer classes like:
framework.service.composer_installer
framework.service.vendor_installer
framework.service.resource.loader

A class can also has the tag "setup_add" and will be called each time a service is added.
